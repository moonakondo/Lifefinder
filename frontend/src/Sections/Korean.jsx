            Chinese Medical Tourism: A New Wave
          </p>

            <br></br>
            Rising wealth, an increasingly top-heavy population pyramid, more
            non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and cultural factors have combined
            to fuel a boom in outbound Chinese medical tourism.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            By 2024, the population for urban Chinese aged 40-64 will increase
            by 108 million from 2014, and 57 million more aged 65 and above,
            according to Global Demographics. As these groups suffer
            increasingly from lifestyle diseases that demand cardiovascular and
            cancer treatments, many of the wealthy among them will seek
            procedures in the United States or Europe.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            And many more will use their new-found wealth to take advantage of
            plastic surgery, dentistry and wellness programs in Korea or
            Southeast Asia.

          Plastic Surgery in Korea

          <br />
          Chinese medical tourists see the United States as the pinnacle of
          quality for major procedures, such as cancer treatment and cardiac
          surgery, alongside locations, such as the United Kingdom and
          Singapore. Korea is very popular for plastic surgery and has seen a 35
          percent annual increase in volumes since 2009, primarily patients from
          China who are lured by the Hallyu or “Korean Wave” cultural phenomenon
          (hanliu in Mandarin) created by Korean TV and music exports.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          Southeast Asian countries also report double-digit increases in the
          number of mainland medical tourists in recent years, thanks to an
          influx of Chinese, who make up the fastest growing segment of the
          market and fourth largest in Malaysia where plastic surgery, dentistry
          and non-surgical health programs are popular.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          Singapore is also a common destination, thanks to the quality of care,
          Mandarin language capabilities, and value. Although competitive prices
          can now be found in other Southeast Asian countries and India, Chinese
          millionaires are most concerned about securing the best possible care
          and medical outcomes.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          How Can Hospitals Tap into this Opportunity? The Stanford Research
          Institute reports Chinese medical tourists spent USD10 billion in
          2014, which is only 2.3 percent of the global total of USD430 bn,
          suggesting that there is a huge potential for further growth in the
          market.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          Hospitals hoping to tap into this opportunity will need to provide
          Mandarin speaking staff and nurses, and train clinicians about Chinese
          perceptions of healthcare, which are still influenced by millennia-old
          concepts of Traditional Chinese Medicine. On a more practical note,
          they will also benefit from accepting Chinese credit cards, such as
          UnionPay and RMB.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          Bumrungrad Hospital in Bangkok goes a step further, offering a range
          of premier and VIP suites, a 24-hour hotline, and embassy contact,
          airport transfer, reception and a visa application assistance services
          to create a 5-star hotel-like medical tourism experience.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          At the government level, as competitors as diverse as Turkey, India
          and the Philippines compete for Chinese medical tourists, electronic
          visa applications, special multiple entry visas, dedicated medical
          tourist channels at airports, and freedom to transfer money into the
          country to pay for treatments will all boost a country's share of what
          could become the biggest new wave in medical tourism ever.
